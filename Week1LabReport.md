Lab Report Week 1


To start, you have to download VSCode. I already had this installed, so I skipped this step. Here is a picture of VSCode open.

To remotely connect, you must set up your account. Figure out your account name by going [here](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSVKwPS8iJZvIqVveF8sfNB_yRn7o1MCEs2mxHpmow&s), then type in your username and student ID in "Account Lookup," and hit submit. Next, click on your account name, it will follow the format cs15lfa22zz. When you click on that name, it will bring you to a page that has a link asking to change your password. Enter your current password and new password, but do not clikck the check password button. Then, hit return. Wait 15-60 minutes. Go to your terminal, and type in ssh ACCOUNT_NAME@ieng6.ucsd.edu and your password at the prompt. It will look like the image shown below. Then open VSCode, and download git(I already had it installed). In VSCode, let your terminal use git bash. Do this by following the instructtions in this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994). Once this is done, open a terminal in VSCode, and type in $ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu, with the zz replaced by the letters in your username. Do not type the $, this should already be there. You may get a message asking if you want to continue connecting, just type yes. You are now remotely connected.

Now that you are connected, you can try some commands by simply typing them into the terminal and hitting enter. Try out cs, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp. It should look something like this.
