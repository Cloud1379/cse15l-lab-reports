Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+v><enter>` <br><br>
I pasted my login details for ieng6, `ssh cs15lwi23ade@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, and was automatically logged in without having to type in my password. 
  
# Step 5

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+v><enter>` <br><br>
I pasted in the command to clone my fork named lab7, which was `git clone git@github.com:Cloud1379/lab7.git`. I got this from the SSH option on github. 
  
# Step 6

Keys pressed: `cd la<tab><enter>`, `<Ctrl+v><enter>`, `<Ctrl+v><enter>` <br><br>
First, I changed my directory into lab7. I used `<tab>` in order to do less typing. Then I accessed the 
`javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command by pasting it in. Then I accessed the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command by also pasting it in. 

# Step 7

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+v><enter>`, `<trackpad scroll><right>(12x)<backspace><2>`,`<Ctrl+x><enter><Ctrl+o>` <br><br>
First, I pasted in the command to enter nano, `nano ListExamples.java`. Then, I used my laptop's trackpad to scroll down to 
line 43, which said `index1 += 1;` I then pressed `right` 12 times, and replaced the 1 with a 2. To save, I 
pressed `<Ctrl+x>` and then hit enter, and to exit, I pressed `<Ctrl+o>`. 

# Step 8

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><enter>` <br><br>
To run the tests, I just had to access the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command, which was 3 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it. Then I accessed the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command which was also 3 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow again to access it. 

# Step 9

Keys pressed: `git add .`, `<Ctrl+v><enter>`, `<Ctrl+v><enter>` <br><br>
First, I typed in the command `git add .` to prepare to commit. Then, I pasted in the command `git commit -m lab7` in order to commit the change in my code. Finally, to push the command to my Github account, I pasted in the command `git push  git@github.com:Cloud1379/lab7.git`
